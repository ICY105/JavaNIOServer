A basic implementation of an NIO server that accepts TCP and UDP connections on the same port. Runs a simple database that stores and retrieves events (consisting of name, description, date, and group) based on commands received from the network.
Has a simple client for sending messages to the server. Can be toggled between TCP and UDP.

Created for Network Programming class.
